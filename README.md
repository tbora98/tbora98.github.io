# Personal Academic Website (GitHub Pages)

This is a minimal, single‑page **academic profile** ready to host for free with **GitHub Pages**.
No frameworks, no build step — just HTML & CSS.

## Quick Deploy (2 minutes)

1. Create a new GitHub repository named **`YOURUSERNAME.github.io`** (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repo (drag & drop in the GitHub UI is fine).
3. Add an empty file named `.nojekyll` (included here) to skip Jekyll processing.
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** and make sure it serves from the `main` branch, root folder.
5. Your site will be live at: `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`

## Customize

- `index.html` — edit content (name, links, sections). Search for `Trisha Bora` and replace.
- `style.css` — tweak colors/typography.
- `cv/Trisha_Bora_CV.pdf` — replace with your actual CV.
- Update links for Google Scholar, ORCID, GitHub, LinkedIn, and paper PDFs/BibTeX.

## Tips

- Keep publications in reverse chronological order.
- Add project images to `assets/` and reference them in your cards.
- To use a custom domain later, add a `CNAME` file with your domain name.

**Enjoy your free, fast academic site!**
